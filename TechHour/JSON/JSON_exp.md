#JSON Files

####What are they? Were do they come from? What do they do??

** JSON (canonically pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/ JAY-sən; sometimes JavaScript Object Notation) is an open-standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs. **


** JSON is the most common data format used for the transfer of data between browser(client side) and Web Server. **

** JSON is based on javascript originally but is now ported to a large number of languages ranging from traditional JS to PHP and even Java. **

** refer to RFC 7159 for a full semantic and security related information **

** Information used in this document was sourced from GOOGLE and WIKI. All information is open source and free to the general public **

## Some Basic Guide-lines for the Newbies(No worries we have all been their):

1. JSON files are written in plain text:
..* no fancy markup languages
..* no programming logic is used.

2. JSON files can be written using:
..* basic text editor
..* third party JSON editors
..* JSON tools provided within IDE's

3. JSON can have multiple data types:
..* Number - a signed decimal value in the real mathmatical domain
..* String - a sequence of proper unicode charaters
..* Boolean - of course TRUE or FALSE
..* Array - basic array structure (may be empty array)
..* Objects - an unordered collection of key=>value pairs associated with a certain object format, must follow proper object syntax.
..* Null
..* Note:: white space is allowed between data and ignored unless contained within a string value (more on this below)
